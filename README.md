The Sound of Waves, part of CodexBoston2017. 

## Why
I'm interested in how different authors sound. Why does Hemingway sound different from Faulkner? What makes them sound different? I wanted a tool to help me explore the rhythm of a text, so I built this app.

## The Title
The title comes from one of my favorite books, Yushio Mishima's <i>Sound of Waves</i>, a book with beautiful rhythms.

## What
An app that converts text-to-speech, and then renders the waveforms of the rendered speech.

## How
It uses:
1. http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/ to convert text to speech audio.
2. https://wavesurfer-js.org/ to render the audio as a waveform.

## Thoughts
The relationship between written and spoken text is complex. When we *read* text, we *see* word boundaries and whitespace. But when we *hear* text, there are actually very few pauses in the sound.
